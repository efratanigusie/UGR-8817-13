00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.430
The best way to fight breast cancer is to
have a plan.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.510
What's my plan?

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.630
I have a good plan Every month.

4
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.760
Every month I do a self-exam.

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.710
I do mine in the shower every month.

6
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.780
Then once a year, I go see my nurse
practitioner.

7
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.390
I see my nurse practitioner for a clinical
exam.

8
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.420
When it was time I got started getting a
mammogram.

9
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.060
Every year I do my self exam, my clinical
exam with my nurse practitioner, and then

10
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.160
yeah, I get a mammogram every year.

11
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.810
Why? Why do I do it?

12
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.920
Because I want to fight.

13
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.180
I'm going to fight.

14
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.350
You have to fight.

15
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.030
And that's my fight plan.

16
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.650
That's my fight plan.

17
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.880
And I'm winning.
